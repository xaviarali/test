#Intro
========

* This Server is written in "NodeJs".
* Database:  rethinkdb, a NoSQL DB.
* Languages: C for extracting Data out of Flat Files.
* The Flat Files are located inside the /var/vigilant directory. 
  In the event, the server is moved appropiate directory. i.e /var/var/vigilant

How to run
===========
1. From the terminal/console, change directory to the node folder 
2. run `npm install`
3. run `ps -el | grep node`
4. Find the process number
5. kill the process.
6. run 'nohup nohup node bin/www &'


Database Setup
=============
1. Install Rethinkdb (http://rethinkdb.com/)
2. Run rethinkdb server
3. Open the admin console at http://localhost:8080
4. Create a database named "oneir"
5. Create a table named "users" in the DataExplorer section of the admin, then create the following index:
 	`r.db('oneir').tableCreate('users', {primaryKey:'username'})`
	`r.db("oneir").table("users").indexCreate("login", [r.row("username"), r.row("password")])`
6. To start the DB server use the following command:
      /etc/init.d/rethinkdb start
7. To restart the DB server use the following command:
      /etc/init.d/rethinkdb restart

C Programs
=============
The C program are located in a directory name 'FlatFileInterface' which is located inside 'Services' Directory.
Path: var/oneir-cloud/services/FlatFileInterface/

The directory contains the following folder & files:

1) Source Code (Directory)
                 - menu_selection.c
                 - company_selection.c
2) menu_selection.exe
3) company_selection.exe

The C programs are build using Ubuntu x86 Machine.
They are also tested on CentOs x86 Machine.

# To Rebuild Executables for Linux use the Source Code:

    Goto 'src' directory and type the following command:
     1) 'gcc -std=c99 menu_selection.c -o menu_selection'
     2) 'gcc -std=c99 company_selection.c -o company_selection'

# Change the executable permission for each files using the following command:
      'chmod 711 menu_selection company_selection'
      1) Company Selector i.e company_selection.exe (Build for CentOs & Ubuntu x86 Machines)
      2) Menu Selector i.e menu_selection.exe (Build for CentOs & Ubuntu x86 Machines)

# Note: Make sure to give them correct File permissions
     i.e 711
#Info:
      We are using 'child_process' module to execute to C programs.In short, instead of taking the whole burden on Node Server shoulders we are asking the OS for help.
